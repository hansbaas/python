Assembling a new pc

It seems so easy and straight forward: get a case, power supply, a motherboard, a cpu and some ram and you're ready to rock 'n' roll. Well, it is and it isn't: if you know what you're doing when you mount and connect stuff and if are handy and confident, you should be able to pull it off and save yourself a fair bit of money.

The key to success is compatibility. If the components you get are able to work together, your system should work.

So where to start? In this article I will describe the situation that someone's pc 'died' and was asking me for my opinion. She didn't particularly fancy spending four, five hundred euro on a new pc, so after doing several tests on various components and reducing the failure to either motherboard or cpu I proposed to replace some parts and, spending 130 euro, creating a reasonably up-to-date computer for her to work with.

Already having the case meant I had to pick a motherboard that met the size requirements from the case, a micro-ATX. I started studying the available boards and their characteristics and found that the next inportant feature after the form factor is the socket type for the processor. So I started looking for a cheap yet reliable cpu, choose a socket type and looked for motherboards that would take the processor.
